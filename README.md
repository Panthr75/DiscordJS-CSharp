# DiscordJS-CSharp
An attempt at converting the entirety of discord.js into C#
___
### THIS PROJECT IS NOT YET COMPLETED
Once it is though, releases will be posted, and each release will get their own seperate branch.

For example, Discord.JS v12.2.0 will go on the 12.2.0 branch.

The master branch will serve as the current development for the latest version of Discord.JS.

Otherwise, if a branch has a -dev postfix, it's a development branch, and thus may not be stable.
